<h1>Setting up an EAC-PKI for Testing</h1>
<p>This document explains how to set up an Extended Access Control Public Key Infrastructure (EAC-PKI) for
   development and testing purposes.<p>
<p>EAC-PKIs are used for Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTD), some national identification cards and electronic
   drivers licenses. As the name implies, it is used to control which terminal is allowed to access certain data
   on the chip embedded in an identification document.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>An EAC-PKI consists of a three layer PKI:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Country Verifying Certification Authority (CVCA),</li>
	<li>the Document Verifier (DV) and</li>
	<li>the Inspection System (IS).
</ol>
<p>The CVCA is at the root of the PKI. It issues self-signed certificates as trust anchors and link certificates
   to connect subsequent trust anchors. The CVCA certifies subordinate Document Verifier.</p>
<p>A Document Verifier is responsible for terminals of a certain control sector. Beside other functional 
   components, it contains the Document Verifier Certification Authority (DVCA) that issues certificates 
   for inspections systems requiring access to data stored in the chip of the identification document.</p>
<p>Terminals hold a private key to authenticate against the chip in an identification document. To
   prove the authenticity of the key, it must present a chain of certificates, starting with a certificate
   issued by the trust anchor on the chip up to and including the terminals certificate.</p>
<p>Terminals can either be integrated or distributed. In an integrated terminal, the private key is stored in
   a secure cryptographic module integrated in the terminal. In a distributed terminal, the key is stored in a secure
   cryptographic module located in a terminal control center (TCC) to which terminals are attached.</p>
<p>An EAC-PKI uses self-descriptive Card Verifiable Certificates (CVC) rather than X.509 certificates. 
   CVCs are much smaller than X.509 certificates. They are specifically designed for chips with 
   limited memory and computing power. CVCs can be used with ECDSA and RSA, whereby ECDSA is more common
   due to its faster processing in the chip as well as the reduced size of signatures and public keys.</p>
<h2>The Development and Test EAC-PKI</h2>
<p>The EAC-PKI supplied as part of the script bundle in the OpenSCDP project implements a CVCA, a DVCA and a terminal
   control center. It supports synchronous and asynchronous web services as defined in TR-03129 to request
   certificates and to sign requests for terminal authentication. It has a web interface for user interaction
   and automation of tests.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The EAC-PKI requires the <a href="http://www.openscdp.org/scriptingserver/index.html">Scripting Server</a>
   runtime environment. For download and installation follow the instructions.</p>
<p>The EAC-PKI can be deployed on a running Scripting Server using the loadserver.cmd batch file supplied in the
   icao/cvca directory. The batch file is configured for installations on localhost. It installs all three components
   (CVCA, DVCA and TCC) on the same machine.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Each service offers a web user interface at the same URL at which the service responds to web service requests.</p>
<p>In the default configuration,<p>
<ul>
<li>the CVCA is located at <a href="http://localhost:8080/se/cvca">http://localhost:8080/se/cvca</a>,</li>
<li>the DVCA is located at <a href="http://localhost:8080/se/dvca">http://localhost:8080/se/dvca</a> and</li>
<li>the TCC is located at <a href="http://localhost:8080/se/tcc">http://localhost:8080/se/tcc</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an initial workflow you will need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate a root certificate at the CVCA</li>
<li>Update CVCA certificates at the DVCA using a synchronous request</li>
<li>Request an initial certificate asynchronously at the DVCA</li>
<li>Change to the CVCA page to see the pending request</li>
<li>Select the request and respond with "ok_cert_available"</li>
<li>Change to the DVCA page to see the new certificate</li>
<li>Update CVCA and DVCA certificates at the TCC using a synchronous request</li>
<li>Request an initial certificate asynchronously at the TCC</li>
<li>Change to the DVCA page to see the pending request</li>
<li>Select the request and respond with "ok_cert_available"</li>
<li>Press the refresh button on the TCC page to see the new certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>The EAC-PKI is now operational and will accept requests to obtain a signature for terminal authentication.</p>
<p>This can be tested using the tccconnection.js script located in the /icao directory. The script
   can be executed with the <a href="http://www.openscdp.org/scsh3/index.html">Smart Card Shell</a> or 
   using the <a href="http://www.openscdp.org/sse4e/index.html">Eclipse Plug-In</a>. The scripts declares
   a class implementing the web service call. A simple test is performed by entering<p>
<pre>
&gt;load("icao/tccconnection.js");
&gt;TCCConnection.test();
</pre>
<p>If all is configured well, then the output should be:</p>
<pre>
Received certificates:
CVC id-IS DV (official domestic) CAR=UTCVCA00001 CHR=UTDVCA00001 CED=27. Mai 2010 CXD=30

Signature verification: true
</pre>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The default configuration provides for a reasonable setup for testing on localhost. It uses short certificate
   expiration times and maximum rights.</p>
<p>All configuration is done in the configureservices.js script. The script is run on the server as part of the deployment
   process and creates the requires services.</p>
<p>To create your own configuration, you will need to create your own configuration script and adapt the loadserver.cmd
   batch file accordingly.</p>
<p>The default configuration contains four sections,
   a global settings section and one section for CVCA, DVCA and TCC.</p>
<h3>Global settings</h3>
<p>The datadir variable defines the directory that is used to store persistent data. It is set to
   c:\data\eacpki by default. Each service instance uses it's own directory starting with this base name.</p>
<p>The url variable defines the base URL at which services are available. It is set to http://localhost:8080 in
   the default configuration.</p>
<h3>CVCA section</h3>
<p>A CVCA (or DVCA/TCC) service is created using the three lines
<pre>
var cvca = new CVCAService(datadir +  "/cvca", "UTCVCA");
var cvcaui = new CVCAUI(cvca);
SOAPServer.registerService("cvca", cvca, cvcaui);
</pre>
<p>The first statement creates a CVCA service with the certificate holder name "UTCVCA", storing data
   in the /cvca directory of the data store.</p>
<p>The second statement creates a user interface for this service.</p>
<p>The final statement registers the service and it's user interface with the
   SOAPServer under the relative URL "cvca". The SOAP server is a Scripting Server
   component listening at http://localhost:8080/se for incoming requests.</p>
<p>To issue certificates, a CVCA requires three policies, one for self-signed root certificates,
   one for link certificates and a finale one for DV certificates.</p>
<p>A certificate policy is defined as JavaScript object using the following notation:</p>
<pre>
// The policy used to issue DV certificates
var dVPolicy = { certificateValidityDays: 4,
				   chatRoleOID: new ByteString("id-IS", OID),
				   chatRights: new ByteString("A3", HEX),
				   includeDomainParameter: false,
				   extensions: null,
				   authenticatedRequestsApproved: false,
				   initialRequestsApproved: false,
				   declineExpiredAuthenticatedRequest: true
				 };
</pre>
<p><code>certificateValidityDays</code> defines the number of days a newly issued certificate will be valid,
   starting this the current date.</p>
<p><code>chatRoleOID</code> is a ByteString containing the object identifier to be used in the Certificate
   Holder Authorization Template (CHAT) to identify the terminal type and format of the template.</p>
<p><code>chatRights</code> is a ByteString containing the object identifier to be used in the Certificate
   Holder Authorization Template (CHAT) to identity the role and rights of the entity to which the
   certificate is issued.</p>
<p><code>shellModelForExpirationDate</code> limits expiration date of issued certificate to expiration date of issuing certificate.</p>
<p><code>includeDomainParameter</code> selects whether domain parameters are included as part of the public key or not.</p>
<p><code>extensions</code> is an array of ASN1 objects that are added as Certificate Extensions.</p>
<p><code>authenticatedRequestsApproved</code> allows to select, if authenticated certificate requests (requests signed by the
   valid current key of the subordinate instance) are automatically approved and certified. If not approved and
   if asynchronous processing is allowed, such requests are added to a list of pending requests and
   need explicit approval by an operator.</p>
<p><code>initialRequestsApproved</code> allows to select, if initial requests are approved without operator action.</p>
<p><code>declineExpiredAuthenticatedRequests</code> allows to select, if authenticated requests with a signature based
   on an expired certificate should be declined (failure_expired). If set to false, such requests are added to the
   pending requests list and can be approved manually.</p>
<p><code>shellModelForExpirationDate</code> if set to true, then the expiration date of a certificate issued
   by this CA will be limited to the expiration date of the CA's certificate. This must be set to false for
   issuing root or link certificates.</p>
